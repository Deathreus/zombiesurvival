# Zombie Survival Singleplayer Edition
This is a singeplayer rewrite fork of the original game mode written by JetBoom.
I will be changing quite a bit of the core gamemode to make it viable for playing alone.

### Features include:
* A fully comprehensive AI director that checks your fighting ability and increases the zombie threat accordingly
* Dynamically spawning NPCs that check both distance to player and LOS
* The director is predisposed to giving you small breaks rather than a wave system
* The end goal is to just survive until the map time runs out
* You can access the point shop at any time but at a cost penalty
* Some weapons have been made free so you can never find yourself without one
* Some perks have been applied to you from the start

## Balancing
Some items have been removed and most items have been tweaked to better fit the lack of additional players. The Barricade Kit, Detonation Pack and Force Field Emitter have been removed, these would just be too good of items to have against NPCs. Grenades are guaranteed to kill a Poison Zombie at point blank, making them the go-to tool for group clearance, and as such have an increased price. To prevent situations where you would be without a weapon, 'Battleaxe' Pistol, 'Shredder' SMG, 'Stubber' Rifle and 'Crackler' Assaut Rifle have had free versions added to the worth shop, these are a bit less powerful than their counterparts but come with more ammo, the Knife and Plank is free as is. The Arsenal Crate and the Resupply Box have had their cost increased, but the Resupply Box pays out more ammo per use and you don't need the Arsenal Crate to access the point shop(Though using the point shop without one incurs a 20% cost penalty). It would be pretty hard to maintain a barricade and keep the zombie population in check by yourself, so there is a new item that automatically repairs nails, it does it at a slow rate, but it does it for free!
